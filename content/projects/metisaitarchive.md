## METIS AIT Archive

The METIS AIT Archive will be used to store the data for the Mid-infrared E-ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS).

See https://github.com/AstarVienna/MetisWISE

The server consists of two components

- a metadata database, and
- a bulk data storage for the FITS files.

The core is a Python library that contains the data model.
