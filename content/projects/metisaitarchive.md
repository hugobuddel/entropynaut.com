## METIS AIT Archive

The METIS AIT Archive will be used to store the data produced during the Assembly, Integration and Test (AIT) phase of the Mid-infrared E-ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS).

Entropynaut won the bid for developing the METIS AIT Archive software. A prototype is available on https://github.com/AstarVienna/MetisWISE.

The core technology is a Python library that contains the data model, which maps the data to SQL tables.
