## Telluric Correction

Hugo Buddelmeijer is currently working on updating the telluric correction of the Very Large Telescope to be suitable for the Extremely Large Telescope, however not in the capacity of Entropynaut.

In particular, a blind telluric correction is being implemented, that allows the correction to be performed without any fitting.
